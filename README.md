# BKT-Jupyter
Demonstration of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing

## Google Colab Set Up

1. Sign in to https://colab.research.google.com/

2. On top left of the Google Colab interface, click File > Upload Notebook

3. Browse to the folder (extracted from submitted zip file) and locate ".ipynb" file, upload the file. Google will create a colab folder on your Google Drive and store the newly uploaded file there. The file should be open and the content of the file should be identical to the content of the ".pdf" file (it is an actual print out of our Google Colab view of the .ipynb file)

## Upload Data Sets

4. On the top right of the Google Colab interface, click Connect > Connect to host runtime

5. Make sure the left column of the Google Colab interface is extended. Click Files > Upload. Select the .csv files to upload. Google will only store these files per active session (you may have to repeat this step next time you open Google Colab)

## Execute codes

6. Contents are organized by blocks. On the top left of each block, there is a play button. Once clicked, the codes within the block will be executed. Blocks have to be executed sequentially and in order. Another short cut is CTRL-F9 (automate execution of code blocks)
